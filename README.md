# Pico_Template (0.9.0)
An MDK template for Raspberry Pi Pico

- Compiler: Arm Compiler 6.16 (Using non-intrusive wrapper to support pico-sdk which is written in GCC)
- ***It works as you wanted!***


# Known issue
- Debugger support is not available for now.
- Not all peripheral modules are added to the compilation. But I guess it is just a piece of cake for you : P
- ***Please use the elf2uf2 tool in this template*** to convert the generated axf into uf2.
- Need to write some documents...
